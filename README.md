### How to Set Up and Run the Project

1. **Clone or create the project directory** based on the structure above.
2. **Install dependencies** using `pip` as shown in the `README.md`.
3. **Run the project** by executing `./runner.sh`, which will capture keystrokes and audio, and combine the data into a single file.
4. **Review the `combined_output.bin`** to check that the data has been stored correctly.

By organizing the project in this manner, you'll maintain clear separation between each functionality (keylogging, audio recording, and consolidation), which helps with debugging, future improvements, and better collaboration.
